# AI-Enhanced Floorplan Analysis

This application now includes AI-powered automation features to help engineers work more efficiently with floorplan measurements.

## ü§ñ AI Scale Detection

The AI Scale Detector automatically reads and interprets scale notations from floorplan images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

### Features:
- **Automatic Scale Reading**: Detects common architectural scale notations like "1:100", "1/4" = 1'-0"", "1cm = 1m"
- **Multiple Pattern Recognition**: Supports various scale formats used in architectural drawings
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence ratings for detected scales
- **Manual Override**: Users can review and manually select from detected results

### Supported Scale Formats:
- Ratio scales: `Scale: 1:100`, `1:50`
- Imperial scales: `1/4" = 1'-0"`, `1" = 10'-0"`  
- Metric scales: `1cm = 1m`, `1mm = 10mm`
- Reference objects: Common architectural elements for scale reference

### Usage:
1. Upload a floorplan image
2. Click "Auto-Detect" in the calibration modal
3. Review detected scales with confidence ratings
4. Select the most appropriate result or use manual calibration

## üîç Enhanced Perimeter Detection

The Enhanced Perimeter Detector uses advanced computer vision techniques for automatic boundary detection.

### Detection Methods:
- **Contour Detection**: Advanced edge detection with multiple preprocessing approaches
- **Hough Line Detection**: Identifies straight lines and connects them into rectangles
- **Edge Linking**: Connects nearby edge points to form complete boundaries
- **Multi-method Fusion**: Combines results from different approaches for better accuracy

### Features:
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each detected perimeter gets a confidence rating
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Removes similar results and keeps the best ones  
- **Hole Detection**: Identifies and handles internal exclusions
- **Interactive Refinement**: Users can manually adjust detected boundaries

## üéØ Workflow Integration

### Before AI (Manual Process):
1. Upload floorplan ‚Üí 2. Manual scale calibration ‚Üí 3. Manual perimeter tracing ‚Üí 4. Area calculation

### After AI (Automated Process):
1. Upload floorplan ‚Üí 2. **AI auto-detects scale** ‚Üí 3. **AI detects perimeters** ‚Üí 4. Review and refine ‚Üí 5. Instant area calculation

## üìä Benefits for Engineers

- **Time Savings**: Reduce measurement setup from minutes to seconds
- **Accuracy**: OCR reads exact scale values without human interpretation errors  
- **Consistency**: Standardized detection algorithms ensure repeatable results
- **Focus on Analysis**: Spend time on design decisions rather than measurement setup
